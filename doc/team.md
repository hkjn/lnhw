We can add a paragraph describing ourselves under the doc/ subdirectory.

The following areas of expertise are needed:

- crypto knowledge
  - understand how LN channel updates are done
  - understand how 2/2 segwit transactions are structured and signed

- ui skills
  - for desktop client and hardware wallet ui

- programming language skills
  - any might be useful
  - but we do need to understand how `hsm.c` manages secrets if we are to extract that work to the hw wallet!
